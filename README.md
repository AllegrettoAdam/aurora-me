This tracker allows you to find auroras near you, or anywhere in the world for that matter. You can put in your current location and it tells you the closest place where you have a chance of seeing an aurora, and the percent chance that you do.

This is also a social sphere as many people care about auroras in their lives, and want to share this life changing experience with others! You can post photos of your latest aurora sighting to show off to your friends and see other auroras people captured photos of.
