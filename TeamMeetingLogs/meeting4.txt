Date: 19 November 2024
Meeting 4

Decisions:
  - None

Alternative Actions/Options Discussed:
  - In the event that we cannot implement a third party image storing software for the database prior to the deadline, 
    we will create folder containing some demo profile and post images that we can then store the
    relative path for in the database.

Follow-up items:
  - Abraham: Before thanksgiving break I will have completed and tested the social/discover page and will hopefully 
    have also implemented functionality for the user to post their own images.
  - Ramsey: Before thanksgiving break I will finished implementing the functionality of the profile page. Additionally
    I will have added a third-party API for the purpose of minimizing storage use of images and for user image upload 
    capability.
